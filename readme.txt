eViihde 1.0 and 1.1 sources.

1.0 is meant to be compiled with 10.7 OSX or older (10.5 or newer)
1.1 is meant to be compiled with 10.8 OSX

1.1 is production version. 1.0 is out of date, only for older OSX versions.

Check build baths because those can point to my home directory on already long gone laptop... :)
